Cuisine Form:
The "Meal Selector" form allows users to input a cuisine type. Upon submission, it returns meals that match the selected cuisine type.

Rendered Meals:
The meals in the "Meals" section populate based on the cuisine type that was entered into the cuisine form. The rendered meals initially pull in an image, name, likes and comments. These elements all come from server data. Users have ability to increase the likes and submit additional comments. Doing this updates the server data. When a user hovers over a meal, the time to cook, servings, and ingredients for the recipe show. Each ingredient has an “add button”. This add button adds the ingredient to the Grocery List.

Grocery List:
The grocery list populates ingredients, based on which ingredients the user has added from the meal cards. The grocery list also contains a form: This allows users to manually input ingredients that were not included in the recipe ingredients. Each ingredient has a "delete button," should the user no longer need to purchase this ingredient.
